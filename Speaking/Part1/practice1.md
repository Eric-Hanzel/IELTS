### Q1: How often do you see your neighbours? [Why/Why not?]

I don't see my neighbors very often. We mostly **keep to ourselves (不与人来往)**, and our **schedules (日程安排)** tend to be different. However, when 
we do see each other, it's usually **in passing (偶然提到)**, like when we're **out for a walk (出去散步)** or checking the mail. Occasionally, we might 
chat briefly about something like the weather or any community updates. I think it's just because we're all busy with our 
own lives, but it's always nice to **catch up (叙旧)** when we have a chance.

### Q2: Do you invite your neighbours to your home? [Why/Why not?]

I don't typically invite my neighbors over. While I **get along with them (相处)**, I prefer to keep my personal space private. 
I think it's **partly (某种程度上)** because we don't interact much outside of **casual (随意的)** greeting, and it feels more comfortable that way. 
However, if there were a special occasion, like a holiday or neighborhood event, I'd be open to inciting them over for a **small 
gathering (聚会)**. I think it's always nice to build a stronger connection, but for now, I prefer keeping it more casual.

### Q3: Do you think you are a good neighbour? [Why/Why not?]

I believe I am a good neighbor. I try to be **considerate (周到)** of each other, like keeping noise levels low,especially during late hours, 
and being mindful of shared space. I also try to help out when I can, like bringing in the mail if I notice a neighbor's package or 
offering a hand when they seem to need it. I think being respectful and kind helps create a good atmosphere in the neighborhood. 
That said , I could probably do more to engage with them, but I try to be approachable and polite whenever I do interact.

### Q4: Has a neighbour ever helped you? [Why/Why not?]

Yes, a neighbor has helped me before. There was one time when I had a problem with my car, and I was stuck outside. A neighbor 
noticed and offered to help by giving me a **jump-start (助动启动)**. It was really kind of them, especially since we hadn't 
interacted much before. It made me appreciate the sense of community and how neighbors can look out for one another. I try to return 
the favor when I can, whether it's offering help with a task or just being there for a chat.
